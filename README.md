## :thinking: What is this project about?

The goal of this project is to create a random data generator with a wide range of values for keys and values in a given object.
There are several languages and options available for use. This source code is available to everyone.

When executing the script or making a request to the API (Possibly in the future?), the user will be able to choose one of the different possibilities of content that will be generated and fed in a JSON.

Example: Subject "HUMAN":

```
{
  "human": {
    "date":{
      "name": {
          	"fullname": "Paolo Django de Santo",
          	"name": "Paolo",
          	"surname": "Django de Santo",
          	...
        },
      "age": "22",
      "birth": "1998-01-10",
      "zodiacsign": "Capricorn",
      "bloodtype": "A+",
      "head": {
      		"hair": {
      			"type": "curly hair",
      			"color": "blonde",
      			"size": "20inches"
      			...
      		}
      },
      "relationship": {
      		"status":"single"
      		"family": {
      				"married": "no",
      				"children": "no"
      				...
      		}
      },
      and over 1000's of randomly and automatically generated options...
    }
  }
}

```
