# RandomDATA101 - Python
The idea is to set up a random data generator with a wide variety of keys/values ​​in a given object. Several languages ​​will be available and ALL of them will have the same usage. The final file will be a JSON with the generated data. The initial object will be "human".

Example: When executing the script or making a request to the API (Possibly in the future?), the user will be able to choose one of the different possibilities of content that will be generated and fed in a JSON. In theory, hundreds of value pairs will be available in hundreds of JSON keys.
```
{
  "human": {
    "date":{
      "name": [
          "fullname": "Paolo Django de Santo",
          "name": "Paolo",
          "surname": "Django de Santo"
        ],
      "age": "22",
      "bloodtype": "A+",
      and over 1000's of randomly and automatically generated options...
    }
  }
}

```


# Initial language:
- Python

## Step by step
- [X] First steps (create repository, start readme).
- [X] Write initial idea.
- [X] Determine which initial languages ​​will be available.
- [X] Determine what will be the file tree.
- [ ] Create IMAGE and LOGO for repository.
- [ ] Improve README from repository updates.
- [ ] Document EVERYTHING.
- [ ] Improve the documentation. \The/
- [X] Choose the keys of the initial option.
- [ ] Choose and write the hundreds of values ​​for each individual KEY. (Keys with numeric values ​​will not need this option(We can generate random number values ​​with some methods or frameworks(math.Random() in python)).)
    * Template: nameFem = {"ana", "lucia", "Jessica", "Brianna"};
    * Template: nameMan = {"Gabriel", "Joseph", "Khan", "Victor"};
- [ ] Study what will be the best option for the algorithm (speed and ease of maintenance) (Put everything straight into the JSON together or divide everything into sublayers?) (Split into arrays or leave everything in a single array).
- [ ] Functional or OOP?
- [ ] Video demonstrating algorithm running WITHOUT JSON (alpha phase).
- [ ] Video demonstrating algorithm running WITH JSON (beta phase).
- [ ] Add option for random image of non-existing person (Optional).
    * API for image: https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/
    * Second option: https://github.com/David-Lor/ThisPersonDoesNotExistAPI
- [ ] Make a GUI (graphical user interface) for the algorithm (?).
- [ ] Test.
- [ ] Test more.
- [ ] Reorganize github and branches (Split neat folders and ReadME).
- [ ] Assemble presentation for dissemination with GIF.
- [ ] Improve code (Refactoring).
- [ ] Build an API to consume the algorithm.
- [ ] Redo the script for other languages ​​(JS, C++).
